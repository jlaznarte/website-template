Learning Analytics in Higher Education Development: A Roadmap
Adejo, Olugbenga; Connolly, Thomas
Journal of Education and Practice , v8 n15 p156-163 2017
The increase in education data and advance in technology are bringing about enhanced teaching and learning methodology. The emerging field of Learning Analytics (LA) continues to seek ways to improve the different methods of gathering, analysing, managing and presenting learners' data with the sole aim of using it to improve the student learning experience and the study environment. In this paper, we try to explore the concept and salient features of LA potential in higher education and suggest strategies on how this emerging field can make use of data mining techniques alongside learners' data to produce useful and informed decision making. Using the Technology-Organisation-Human frameworks, the paper investigates the roadmap for successful implementation of LA in higher Educational Institutions.
