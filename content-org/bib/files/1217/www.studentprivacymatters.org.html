<p>As this <u><a href="https://www.googletransparencyproject.org/articles/capturing-classroom">Google Transparency Project explains</a></u>,
 Google is promoting itself via GSuite products and Apps into many 
classrooms across America (and the globe).&nbsp; What is Google doing 
with student data?&nbsp; Why is Google allowed to track Location, Voice 
Activity, Web &amp; App Activity, Device Information, YouTube videos 
Searched and Watched of K-12 school children? How are these data being 
used and shared?</p>
<p>What data are being collected and stored (and shared?) via your 
child’s school issued Google GSuite account? We’ll show you how to start
 checking.</p>
<p>In August of 2018 Missouri Education Watchdog<u><a href="http://missourieducationwatchdog.com/whats-stored-in-your-school-google-drive-account-you-might-be-surprised/"> wrote this article</a></u>
 detailing how one Springfield, Missouri family, discovered that their 
school district’s Google’s GSuite platform was collecting and storing 
surprising amounts of personal data about students and, apparently even 
storing information from parents’ and family members’ personal accounts 
(family members’ passwords to banking, work, shopping, bills).&nbsp; 
Others reported on this issue<u><a href="https://www.pogowasright.org/back-to-school-revolt-in-springfield-employees-balk-over-using-google-drive-as-evidence-of-massive-privacy-breach-mounts/"> here</a></u> and <u><a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2018/09/26/stop-googles-kiddie-data-predators-n2522609">here</a></u>.</p>
<p>Missouri Education Watchdog recently followed up with a story highlighting a group of parents and educators asking to <u><a href="https://www.thepetitionsite.com/257/990/573/stop-all-online-advertisements-to-k-12-students/?taf_id=60481222&amp;cid=fb_na#bbfb=131075804">stop online advertisements</a></u> to students.&nbsp; The blog <u><a href="http://missourieducationwatchdog.com/kids-are-being-bombarded-with-online-ads-sometimes-graphic-in-school-time-to-stop-online-ads-to-students/">documents many pop ads</a></u>
 (some very inappropriate) that students are receiving when logged into 
their school accounts, including recommendations from YouTube (owned by

<p><strong>We wonder, how many parents <u>have seen and agreed to</u> these Terms of Service for your student to use GSuite at school?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1923" src="Picture3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture3.png 974w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture3-300x236.png 300w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture3-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" width="491" height="386"></a><strong>—-PARENTS, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AND AGREED TO THIS NOTICE?</strong></p>
<p>Since reporting on this issue, we have been contacted by parents 
across the country who have reported similar experiences and many have 
raised questions on how to check their child’s school issued 
Google/GSuite account.</p>
<p>None of the parents we have spoken to thus far were shown the Google 
Terms of Service that their child had to agree to. In fact, many of the 
students themselves did not see the Terms of Service, either.&nbsp; 
Presumably, schools are consenting to the Terms of Service for the 
children, in place of parents, (as parent agent).</p>
<p>Some parents, when asked if their child could NOT use Google GSuite 
in school, have been told that if their student does not use the GSuite 
products (i.e., Google Classroom, Google Drive, Google Docs, or Gmail), 
it will be impossible for them to attend this school.&nbsp; <em><strong>Have other parents been told that their child must agree to use GSuite products as a condition of attending their public school?</strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>How do you check settings in your child’s school issued Google GSuite account?</strong></h3>
<p>We are posting instructions below that we have found helpful. Your 
experience may be different, but we suggest parents click on the <span style="color: #0000ff;">Learn More</span>
 links, and any / all links within the Google Account.&nbsp; Set aside 
some time–or do it in pieces.&nbsp; You could take days and still find 
links, more permissions.&nbsp; <u>TAKE NOTES or screen shots</u> (hold 
down Print Screen and Control on your key board).&nbsp; Interestingly, 
parents have anecdotally reported that changes they make to their 
child’s permissions have NOT been saved, have reverted back to allow 
tracking or syncing, or even back to the original password after they 
have changed the GSuite password. We would be curious if this is 
happening to other parents and students. Talk to your school’s IT 
administrator, share your concerns and findings with others to see if 
they can replicate.</p>
<p><strong>Start here:</strong></p>
<p>1.–Log into your child’s school Google GSuite&nbsp; Account.&nbsp; 
(Schools sometimes refer to these as Google Drive accounts, or Gmail, or
 Google Docs… but they are all part of the GSuite package.)</p>
<p>2.–Click on the little circle icon at the top right of the screen (might be a photo of your child, or your child’s initials.).</p>
<p>3.–Click <u><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">Google Account</a></u>.</p>
<p>4.–Start looking and documenting.</p>
<p>Below is what you might see if you go to Security Check up and then <u><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols">Activity Controls</a></u> and then also look at Manage Activity.&nbsp; Are these tracking permissions turned ON or are they “Paused”? <em>Notice the fine print such as, “activity may be saved from time to time” even if you have Web and App Activity paused. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that’s why they label it “paused” and not STOPPED or OFF?</p>

<p>YouTube Search History and YouTube Watch History tracking are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ON</strong> </span>for
 most students we have spoken to. Ask your school IT admin why this 
tracking is on. Ask if they will turn this off for ALL students.</p>
<p><strong>YouTube in K-12 schools.</strong></p>
<p>If YouTube Search or Watch is ON for your student, BE SURE to click <span style="color: #0000ff;">MANAGE ACTIVITY</span>.&nbsp; You, and Google, and school administration can see every YouTube searched and watched while logged into GSuite.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1925" src="Picture5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture5.png 974w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture5-300x84.png 300w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture5-768x214.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" width="562" height="157"></a></p>
<p><strong>Question:&nbsp; why does GSuite offer YouTube to k-12 students, without parent consent,</strong> when YouTube’s <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms">terms of service</a></u> clearly state that users must be 18 years of age or have parent consent prior to using YouTube.</p>
<p>Even more curious:&nbsp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">YouTube Live Chat</span> is apparently available to students.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1926" src="Picture6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture6.png 693w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture6-183x300.png 183w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture6-623x1024.png 623w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" width="332" height="545"></a></p>
<p><strong>YouTube Live Chat for students?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This screen shot is from a 12 year old elementary student’s account, when signed into the school issued GSuite account.&nbsp;</span> Who can communicate with an elementary student via YouTube Live Chat? Why is this offered to students?</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of chats.</strong></p>
<p>Can anyone outside of the school send an email to your child’s school
 gmail account? Can strangers communicate with school children via 
Google Hangouts?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can, <u><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2018/05/22/has_google_built_a_haven_for_creeps_in_victorias_education_apps/">as this report from in Australia suggests</a></u>,
 total strangers communicate with and potentially groom children via 
Google Docs or other chats available via GSuite and Google Apps?</p>
<p>Given that the <u><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180913.aspx">FBI recently warned</a></u> that,&nbsp; <strong>“<em><strong>Ed</strong>Tech could present unique exploitation opportunities for criminals….and could help child predators identify new targets”,</em></strong>&nbsp;
 the ability for strangers to potentially contact k-12 children, via 
school issued GSuite accounts would seem a legitimate security concern.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1927" src="Picture7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture7.png 564w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture7-145x300.png 145w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture7-495x1024.png 495w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" width="403" height="834"></a></p>
<p><strong>Connected Devices.</strong></p>
<p>The <u><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180913.aspx">FBI warning</a></u> also mentions using device information to track children:</p>
<p><strong><em>Inter-connected Networks and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“EdTech connected to networked devices or directly to the
 Internet could increase opportunities for cyber actors to access 
devices collecting data and monitoring children within educational or 
home environments.”</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More Questions:</strong></span></p>
<p>Does Google consider a Device/IP address as personal information? Why
 do devices (regardless of whether it is a Chromebook or Mac, or Windows
 or cellphone) sync and stay signed-in even after logging out?</p>
<p>When checking Account Activity in the student’s Google Account,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> even with Location tracking and Device tracking “paused,“ and after logging out of GSuite account after every use</span>, <strong>this 13 year old student still had 11 devices “signed-in”, complete with device information and location.</strong></span><strong> (Many of these were home or family personal devices that the student had logged into to complete homework.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture8.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1928" src="Picture8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture8.png 974w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture8-300x197.png 300w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture8-768x504.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" width="974" height="639"></a></p>
<p><strong>Logging out is not enough?</strong></p>
<p>Students must Remove the Device, after every use, in order to not be 
signed in.&nbsp; Do schools, parents, teachers, students know this?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture9.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1929" src="Picture9.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture9.png 974w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture9-150x150.png 150w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture9-298x300.png 298w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture9-768x772.png 768w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture9-45x45.png 45w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" width="974" height="979"></a></p>
<p><strong>Who else has access to your child’s GSuite Account?&nbsp;&nbsp; Check Apps and Third Parties.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture11.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1931" src="Picture11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture11.png 764w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture11-160x300.png 160w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Picture11-547x1024.png 547w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" width="764" height="1431"></a></p>
<p>Why should Google allow third party access /connections to school 
children’s shopping habits, social media, etc? Does your child’s GSuite 
account link to any third party shopping services?</p>

<p>There’s plenty more to look at, but this should get you started. Let us know what you find.</p>
<p>Thanks to the federal student privacy law <u><a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/ferpa-changes/">FERPA being weakened in 2011 and 2008</a></u>,
 a student’s personal data can be shared outside of school walls, 
without parents’ knowledge or consent. The data can be shared and 
analyzed by government agencies, nonprofits, businesses, researchers, 
and edtech companies who can further share with third parties, (or <u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/business/for-sale-survey-data-on-millions-of-high-school-students.html">even sell student data</a></u>), or used for <u><a href="http://missourieducationwatchdog.com/kids-are-being-bombarded-with-online-ads-sometimes-graphic-in-school-time-to-stop-online-ads-to-students/">advertising to students</a></u>.</p>
<p>If you are concerned, talk to your school administrator, your legislators. Ask for <u><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/01/17/is-it-time-for-a-federal-data-protection-agency/">strong student data privacy, security, transparency laws</a></u> that allow opt-in consent, enforceable penalties and private right of action, like those passed in Europe (<u><a href="https://www.adlawaccess.com/2018/07/articles/gdpr-sidebar-comparing-the-california-consumer-privacy-act-to-the-gdpr/">GDPR</a></u>) and California (<u><a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/">CCPA</a></u>).</p>

<p>For immediate release: Wednesday, Jan. 23, 2018</p>
<p>For more information contact: Rachael Stickland, rachael@studentprivacymatters.org; 303.204.1272</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first of its kind, the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy 
and the Network for Public Education have released a report card that 
grades all fifty states on how well their laws protect student privacy.</p>
<p><strong>The State Student Privacy Report Card</strong> analyses 99 
laws passed in 39 states plus DC between 2013 and 2018, and awards 
points in each of the following five categories, aligned with <a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/five-principles-to-protect-study-privacy/">the core principles</a> put forward by PCSP: <strong><em>Transparency</em></strong>; <strong><em>Parental and Student Rights</em></strong>; <strong><em>Limitations on Commercial Use of Data</em></strong>; <strong><em>Data Security Requirements</em></strong>; and <strong><em>Oversight, Enforcement, and Penalties for Violations</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Two more categories were added to the evaluation: <strong><em>Parties Covered and Regulated</em></strong> and <strong><em>Other</em></strong>,
 a catch-all for provisions that did not fit into any of the above 
categories, such as prohibiting school employees from receiving 
compensation for recommending the use of specific technology products 
and services in their schools.</p>
<p>No state earned an “A” overall, as no state sufficiently protects 
student privacy to the degree necessary in each of these areas. Colorado
 earned the highest average grade of “B.” Three states – New York, 
Tennessee and New Hampshire– received the second highest average grade 
of “B-“.&nbsp; Eleven states received the lowest grades of “F” because 
they have no laws protecting student privacy: Alabama, Alaska, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, 
South Carolina, Vermont and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The report tracks specific versions of state laws over time.&nbsp; 
For example, many of the state privacy laws enacted since 2013 were 
modeled after the California’s 2014 law known as the Student Online 
Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA). While California barred 
all school vendors from selling student data, eight states subsequently 
passed laws that allowed the College Board and the ACT to do so.&nbsp; 
Laws with specific loopholes to allow&nbsp; these companies to sell 
student data were enacted in Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, 
Nebraska, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia –presumably because 
of lobbying efforts.</p>
<p>The issue of data security is also critical.&nbsp; The primary 
federal student privacy law known as FERPA requires no specific 
protections against data breaches and hacking, nor does it require 
families be notified when inadvertent disclosures occur.&nbsp; In recent
 years, the number of data breaches from schools and vendors have 
skyrocketed, and some districts have even been targeted by hackers with 
attempted blackmail and extortion. &nbsp;A <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/resources/2018-education-report">recent report</a>
 rated the education industry last in terms of cybersecurity compared to
 all other major industries.&nbsp; As a result, this fall the FBI put 
out<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180913.aspx"> an advisory</a>,
 warning of the risks represented by the rapid growth of education tech 
tools and their collection of sensitive student data, &nbsp;saying that 
this could “<strong><em>result in social engineering, bullying, tracking, identity theft, or other means for targeting children</em></strong>.”</p>
<p>“The inBloom debacle in 2013 exposed the longstanding culture of fast
 and loose student data sharing among government agencies, schools and 
companies,” said Rachael Stickland, co-chair of the Parent Coalition for
 Student Privacy, parent of two public school children in Colorado and 
the primary author of the report. “Consequently, parents across the 
nation began urging their state legislators to address the problem, 
resulting in a complex web of state privacy laws that are difficult to 
untangle and understand. Our hope is to bring attention to state laws 
that make a reasonable effort to protect student privacy and identify 
those that need improvement. Parents and advocacy groups can use our 
findings to advocate for even stronger measures to protect their 
children.”</p>
<p>NPE Executive Director Carol Burris noted, “This report card provides
 not only critical information regarding the existing laws, but also 
serves a blueprint for parents to use for lobbying for better 
protections for their children.”</p>
<p>As Leonie Haimson, co-chair of the Parent Coalition for Student 
Privacy, pointed out, “FERPA was passed over forty-five years ago and 
has been weakened by regulation over time to allow for the sharing of 
personal student data by schools and vendors without parent knowledge or
 consent.&nbsp; State legislators have stepped up to the plate to try to

security protections, enforcement, and the ability of parents and 
students to control their own data. Yet none of these laws are robust 
enough in each of these areas.&nbsp; Congress must strengthen and update
 FERPA, but meanwhile, this report card can serve as a guide to parents

<p>Last week, in a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/auditreports/fy2019/a09r0008.pdf">mindboggling audit</a>,
 the Inspector General of the US Department of Education revealed that 
the US Department of Education had utterly failed to respond in a timely
 fashion to&nbsp; complaints filed by parents about the violation of 
their children’s privacy by their schools or districts.</p>
<p>“<em>The Privacy Office is not meeting its statutory obligation to appropriately enforce FERPA and resolve FERPA complaints</em>,” the Inspector General concluded. “<em>Complainants’ privacy rights are also not appropriately protected as FERPA intends.</em>”</p>
<p>In some cases, as the audit reveals, it took up to six years for the Family Policy <span class="st">Compliance Office</span>&nbsp;
 (FPCO) of the US Dept of Education to respond to FERPA 
complaints.&nbsp; Because the office hasn’t kept a systematic record of 
when complaints were filed and then resolved, it was difficult for the 
auditor to even know what the average time before investigations were 
launched, close or responses sent.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of Sept. 2017, there 
were 285 open investigations.</p>
<p>As I was <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2018/11/inspector_general_blasts_ed_department_ferpa.html">quoted in Edweek</a>:&nbsp; “<em>Parents
 have these very serious complaints about their kids’ privacy having 
been violated, and they go through the trouble of filing complaints, but
 they just sit for years without any kind of substantive response.</em>”</p>
<p>To make things worse, when FPCO finally decides that the law has been broken, as they did with <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Agora%20Findings%20letter%20FINAL%2011.2.17.pdf">Agora charter school in Nov. 2017</a>
 , five years after the original complaint, they&nbsp; have never 
imposed any fines or withheld any funding. Years of delay and no 
punishment means yet more reasons for schools and districts to drag 
their feet and continue to violate the law.</p>
<p>Here in NYC,&nbsp; children have suffered as a result of these inordinate delays. In November&nbsp; 2017, <a href="https://nycpublicschoolparents.blogspot.com/2017/11/ferpa-complaint-to-us-dept-of-education.html">Johanna Garcia filed a FERPA complaint</a>
 about the practice of NYC DOE making her family’s personal information 
and that of other families available to charter schools for the purpose 
of letting them mail marketing materials and recruit more 
students.&nbsp; Four <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIx5dzTjw9jeXgefXFf7QVdYX9RWrPqW/view">Council Members wrote a letter </a>in support of Johanna’s complaint to the Mayor and Chancellor Carranza, urging them to halt this practice.</p>
<p>Johanna finally received a written <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ovAVXGeeM3G2N4tmKVZeoDmjqjbaWWD9/view">response from the US DOE</a>
 on September 25,&nbsp; 2018,&nbsp; nearly one year later, saying they 
had finally launched an investigation.&nbsp; Dale King of FPCO <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ovAVXGeeM3G2N4tmKVZeoDmjqjbaWWD9/view">forwarded her a letter</a>
 that he had sent DOE, which asked several&nbsp; piercing questions 
about their privacy practices and their rationale for allowing charter 
schools to access student personal information, while stating that there
 was a deadline of four weeks in which they would have to respond.</p>
<p>Yet DOE further delayed, and apparently sent their response a full 
month after the deadline, on or around November 26.&nbsp; Meanwhile, as I
 feared, charter schools have already begun to send out&nbsp; mailings, 
promoting their schools and urging parents to apply for next year.</p>
<p>On Twitter this morning, Naomi Pena, President of the Community 
Education Council in District 1, posted photos of the glossy brochures 
she just received in the mail from Success Academy charters, run by Eva 
Moskowitz, and the Hebrew Public (sic) Charter Schools, founded by Sara 
Berman, the daughter of billionaire Michael Steinhardt.</p>

<p>Naomi’s last tweet refers to the fact that the DOE makes elected 
Community Education Councils pay the Vanguard mailing house to send 
parents information about what’s happening in their districts — even 
though the DOE could provide parent emails for free.&nbsp; DOE could do 
this either under the directory information exception to FERPA, or the 
school officials exception.&nbsp; In the first case, DOE would have to 
allow parental opt out, in the second case, CECs would have to sign a 
written agreement that they would only use this contact information to 
increase parental involvement and promise not to redisclose the data to 
other entities.</p>
<p>CECs are eligible to be defined as school officials under FERPA as 
by&nbsp; encouraging parental engagement, they are truly providing a 
service to DOE – unlike charter schools, which are providing no services
 to DOE, making them ineligible to be defined as school officials under 
the law.&nbsp; CECs receive very little money from DOE and simply don’t 
have the budget to pay the thousands of dollars to Vanguard that wealthy
 charter school chains like Success and the Hebrew charter schools can 
afford.</p>

<p>An even worse fate has been suffered by Fatima Geidi and her son 
because of the failure of the US Department of Education to carry out 
its responsibilities under the law.&nbsp; On October 30, 2015,&nbsp; 
more than three years ago, Fatima filed a <a href="https://nycpublicschoolparents.blogspot.com/2015/10/ferpa-complaint-from-fatima-geidi-to.html">FERPA complaint</a> against Success Academy after she appeared&nbsp; on the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/charter-schools">PBS News Hour</a>
 to discuss the abusive treatment that her son had experienced at a 
Success charter school.&nbsp; Eva Moskowitz took revenge against her, by
 posting her son’s disciplinary file online, full of false charges, and 
sending it to reporters throughout the nation.</p>
<p>After filing a complaint against this egregious violation of her 
son’s privacy, Fatima received no response from the US Department of 
Education until more than two years later, when she received a letter 
which said that they had initiated an investigation and had asked 
Success for an explanation.&nbsp; On February 16, 2018, they emailed her
 again to say that they had now received a response from Success and in a
 few weeks would let her know the results.</p>
<p>By that time, however, Eva Moskowitz had taken the initial posting of
 the child’s supposed disciplinary offenses down.&nbsp; But instead, she
 had since published the same chronicle of trumped-up allegations 
against him in a book published by Harper Collins on <span class="st">September 12, 2017.</span>
 Fatima had informed the US Dept of Education of this fact as soon as 
she discovered it by filing yet another FERPA complaint on December 20, 
2017, in which she cited her earlier complaint, and wrote that because 
of the delay the harm to her child ‘s privacy had been seriously 
aggravated.</p>
<p>Fatima has heard nothing more from the US Department of Education 
about either her initial or more recent FERPA complaint since February 
2018.&nbsp; Eva Moskowitz’&nbsp; book is still available online and in 
bookstores.&nbsp; Fatima is now in the process of changing her son’s 
name so that in the future, his opportunities will not be wrecked by the
 false allegations made against him, contained in the pages of this 
horrific book.</p>
<p>These are just two stories showing the immense price that NYC parents
 and their children have been forced to pay for the utter failure of the
 US Department of Education to carry out its responsibilities under the 
law.&nbsp; The personal information of children has been handed off by 
DOE like candy to charter schools to help them recruit more students, 
where these children can be further abused and their privacy even more 
seriously violated.</p>

</i></p>
<p>On November 5, about 100 students at the Secondary School of 
Journalism in Brooklyn walked out of their schools to protest the Summit
 online program.&nbsp; This digital instruction program, funded by Mark 
Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates, forces students to spend hours 
staring at computers, left at sea with little human interaction or help 
from their teachers, all in the name of “personalized learning.”</p>
<p>As one of the students, Mitchel Storman, said to Sue Edelman who <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/10/brooklyn-students-hold-walkout-in-protest-of-facebook-designed-online-program/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on the protest</a> in the NY Post, “<i>I
 have seen lots of students playing games instead of working….Students 
can easily cheat on quizzes since they can just copy and paste the 
question into Google.”</i></p>
<p>Senior Akila Robinson said she couldn’t even log onto Summit for 
nearly two months, while other classmates can’t or won’t use it. <i>“The whole day, all we do is sit there.”&nbsp; </i>A teacher said, <i>“It’s a lot of reading on the computer, and that’s not good for the eyes. Kids complain. Some kids refuse to do it.”</i></p>
<p>The online program, which originated in the Summit chain of charter 
schools in California, and was further developed and expanded with 
millions of dollars from the Gates Foundation, Facebook and now the Chan
 Zuckerberg LLC, has now been inserted in more than 300 or so public 
schools, collecting a huge amount of personal data from thousands of 
students without their knowledge or consent or that of their parents.</p>
<p>I have been writing and questioning Summit for the past two years, 
and last year, met with Diane Tavenner, asked her all sorts of questions
 she never responded to, and toured her flagship charter school in 
Redwood City.&nbsp; My description of <a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/update-on-summit-schools-including-my-visit-to-a-summit-charter-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this visit is here</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, parents in 15 states have reached out to me in distress 
about the negative impact of this program on their children. Many report
 that their children, who had previously done well in school,&nbsp; now 
say that they aren’t learning, that they feel constantly stressed, are 
beginning to hate school and want to drop out. Some parents have told me
 that they are now homeschooling their kids or have decided to sell 
their homes and move out of the district.</p>
<p>Recently it was disclosed <a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Summit-newspaper-clipping.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1839 alignright" src="Summit-newspaper-clipping-241x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Summit-newspaper-clipping-241x300.png 241w, https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Summit-newspaper-clipping.png 407w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" width="241" height="300"></a>that
 next year, the Summit program would spin off to a&nbsp; separate 
nonprofit corporation,&nbsp; run by a board led by Priscilla Chan, 
Zuckerberg’s wife and the CZI Chief Financial Officer.&nbsp; Diane 
Tavenner <a href="https://www.the74million.org/summit-is-spinning-off-its-popular-personalized-learning-platform-creating-new-nonprofit-to-take-the-helm/">told reporters</a>&nbsp; the new corporation “<i>doesn’t plan to expand the program, but rather, the new nonprofit will focus on meeting current demand</i>.”&nbsp; Yet a few days ago on <a href="https://twitter.com/SummitPS/status/1060623153163055104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, I saw that Summit is still entreating schools to apply .</p>
<p>Below is a fact sheet I have shared with parents and students<b> </b>at
 Summit schools nationwide, along with questions they can ask their 
schools and districts about the instructional program, its data 
collection and privacy protections (or lack thereof).&nbsp; The fact 
sheet is also available as a <a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Summit-fact-sheet-11.26.28.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdf you can download here</a>.</p>
<p>As it points out in more detail, parents have the right to demand 
that their children’s data be deleted from the online platform, 
according to Summit itself, and to opt out of their children’s directory
 information (name, email, student ID number etc.) provided to Summit 
from now on.&nbsp; Here is a sample letter you can send to your child’s 
principal:</p>
<p><em>Dear Principal [name],</em></p>
<p><em>I hereby demand that all the data of my child [name] in the 
[grade] be immediately deleted from the Summit online system, as is my 
right according to the Summit <a href="https://www.summitlearning.org/privacy-center">Privacy Center</a>.
 I also want to make it clear that from now on, I opt out of&nbsp; [his 
or her] directory information provided to Summit, including name, 
address, student ID number, email address, etc.&nbsp; This is my right 
according to the Summit <a href="https://help.summitlearning.org/hc/en-us/articles/360000808367-Data-Privacy-Addendum">Data Privacy Addendum</a>.&nbsp; Please respond as soon as possible to let me know that you have understood and complied with my request. </em></p>
<p><em>Name, address, email</em></p>
<p>Bravo to the courageous students at Secondary School of Journalism, 
who are fighting&nbsp; for their own right to privacy and a quality 
education, vs Zuckerberg,&nbsp; Gates and the other ed tech oligarchs 
who are attempting to control their classrooms and their personal 
data.&nbsp;<b> </b>As the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/style/digital-divide-screens-schools.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Times series </a>pointed
 out, Silicon Valley corporate leaders and engineers want one kind of 
screen-free education for their own kids, while imposing&nbsp; 
mechanized schooling on everyone else.<b><br>
