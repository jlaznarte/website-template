Responsible research and innovation is an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation.

Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) implies that societal actors (researchers, citizens, policy makers, business, third sector organisations, etc.) work together during the whole research and innovation process in order to better align both the process and its outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of society.

In practice, RRI is implemented as a package that includes multi-actor and public engagement in research and innovation , enabling easier access to scientific results, the take up of gender and ethics in the research and innovation content and process, and formal and informal science education.
Implementing RRI in Horizon 2020

Responsible research and innovation is key action of the ‘Science with and for Society’ objective. RRI actions will be promoted via ‘Science with and for Society’ objective via:

    actions on thematic elements of RRI ( public engagement , open access , gender , ethics , science education ), and 
    via integrated actions that for example promote institutional change, to foster the uptake of the RRI approach by stakeholders and institutions.

RRI is furthermore a ‘cross-cutting issue’ in Horizon 2020, which will be promoted throughout Horizon 2020 objectives. In many cases, inter- and transdisciplinary solutions will have to be developed, which cut across the multiple specific objectives of Horizon 2020. Within the specific objectives of programme, actions can focus on thematic elements of RRI, as well as on more integrated approaches to promote RRI uptake.
