				<div class="block block-text" style="height: 10500px;">
					<p>In 2011, Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and the 
National Institute of Justice published a paper titled “Police Science: 
Toward a New Paradigm,” the ideas of which were developed at the 
Executive Session on Policing and Public Safety hosted at Harvard 
University. The paper calls for a “radical reformation of the role of 
science in policing” that prioritizes evidence-based policies and 
emphasizes the need for closer collaboration between universities and 
police departments.<span id="footnote-1-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="1">1</span>
  In the opening paragraph, the authors, David Weisburd and Peter 
Neyroud, assert that “the advancement of science in policing is 
essential if police are to retain public support and legitimacy.”<span id="footnote-2-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="2">2</span>
 Given that critics of the police associate law enforcement with the 
arbitrary use of force, racial domination, and the discretionary power 
to make decisions about who will live and who will die, the rebranding 
of policing in a way that foregrounds statistical impersonality and 
symbolically removes the agency of individual officers is a clever way 
to cast police activity as neutral, unbiased, and rational. This glosses
 over the fact that using crime data gathered by the police to determine
 where officers should go simply sends police to patrol the poor 
neighborhoods they have historically patrolled when they were guided by 
their intuitions and biases.</p>

<p>This “new paradigm” is not merely a reworking of the models and 
practices used by law enforcement, but a revision of the police’s public
 image through the deployment of science’s claims to objectivity. As 
Zach Friend, the man behind the media strategy of the start-up company 
PredPol (short for “predictive policing”), noted in an interview, “it 
kind of sounds like fiction, but it’s more like science fact.”<span id="footnote-3-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="3">3</span>
 By appealing to “fact” and recasting policing as a neutral science, 
algorithmic policing attempts to solve the police’s crisis of 
legitimacy.</p>

<h2>The Crisis of Uncertainty</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas repression has, within cybernetic capitalism, the role of 
warding off events, prediction is its corollary, insofar as it aims to 
eliminate all uncertainty connected to all possible futures. That’s the 
gamble of statistics technologies. Whereas the technologies of the 
Providential State were focused on the forecasting of risks, whether 
probabilized or not, the technologies of cybernetic capitalism aim to 
multiply the domains of responsibility/authority.<br>
—Tiqqun, <em>The Cybernetic Hypothesis </em>[footnote<em> </em>Tiqqun, “The Cybernetic Hypothesis (<em>L’Hypothèse cybernétique</em>),” <em>Tiqqun 2</em> (2001): 21.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uncertainty is at once a problem of information and an existential 
problem that shapes how we inhabit the world. If we concede that we 
exist in a world that is fundamentally inscrutable for individual 
humans, then we also admit to being vulnerable to any number of risks 
that are outside our control. The less “in control” we feel, the more we
 may desire order. This desire for law and order—which is heightened 
when we are made aware of our corporeal vulnerability to potential 
threats that are unknowable to us—can be strategically manipulated by 
companies that use algorithmic policing practices to prevent crime and 
terrorism at home and abroad. Catastrophes, war, and crime epidemics may
 further deepen our collective desire for security.</p>

<p>In the age of “big data,” uncertainty is presented as an information 
problem that can be overcome with comprehensive data collection, 
statistical analysis that can identify patterns and relationships, and 
algorithms that can determine future outcomes by analyzing past 
outcomes. Predictive policing promises to remove the existential terror 
of not knowing what is going to happen by using data to deliver accurate
 knowledge about where and when crime will occur. Data installs itself 
as a solution to the problem of uncertainty by claiming to achieve total
 awareness and overcome human analytical limitations. As Mark Andrejevic
 writes in <em>Infoglut</em>, “The promise of automated data processing 
is to unearth the patterns that are far too complex for any human 
analyst to detect and to run the simulations that generate emergent 
patterns that would otherwise defy our predictive power.”<span id="footnote-4-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="4">4</span></p>

<p>The anonymous French ultraleftist collective Tiqqun links the rise of
 the crisis of uncertainty to the rise of cybernetics. Tiqqun describes 
cybernetics—a discipline founded by Norbert Wiener and others in the 
1940s—as an ideology of management, self-organization, rationalization, 
control, automation, and technical certitude. According to Tiqqun, this 
ideology took root following World War II. It seeks to resolve “the 
metaphysical problem of creating order out of disorder” to overcome 
crisis, instability, and disequilibrium, which Tiqqun asserts is an 
inherent by-product of capitalist growth.<span id="footnote-5-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="5">5</span>
 However, the “metaphysical” problem of uncertainty that is created by 
crisis enables cybernetic ideology to take root. Drawing on Giorgio 
Agamben’s <em>State of Exception</em>, Tiqqun writes, “The state of emergency, which is proper to all crises, is what allows self-regulation to be relaunched.”<span id="footnote-6-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="6">6</span>
 Even though, by nearly every metric, “Americans now live in one of the 
least violent times in the nation’s history,” Americans believe that 
crime rates are going up.<span id="footnote-7-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="7">7</span>
 Empirically, there is no basis for the belief that there is an 
unprecedented crime boom that threatens to unravel society, but 
affective investments in this worldview expand the domain of 
surveillance and policing and authorizes what Manuel Abreu calls 
“algorithmic necropower.”<span id="footnote-8-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="8">8</span>
 The security state’s calculation of risk through data-mining techniques
 sanctions the targeting of “threats” for death or disappearance. Though
 the goal of algorithmic policing is, ostensibly, to reduce crime, if 
there were no social threats to manage, these companies would be out of 
business.</p>

<p>Whether or not we accept Tiqqun’s account of how capitalist growth 
generates a metaphysical crisis that enables the installation of 
cybernetic governance, it is clear that PredPol appeals to our desire 
for certitude and knowledge about the future. UCLA anthropology 
professor Jeffrey Brantingham emphasizes, in his promotion of PredPol, 
that “humans are not nearly as random as we think.”<span id="footnote-9-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="9">9</span>
 Drawing on evolutionary notions of human behavior, Brantingham 
describes criminals as modern-day urban foragers whose desires and 
behavioral patterns can be predicted. By reducing human actors to their 
innate instincts and applying complex mathematical models to track the 
behavior of these urban “hunter-gathers,” Brantingham’s predictive 
policing model attempts to create “order” out of the seeming disorder of
 human behavior.</p>

<h2>Paranoia</h2>

<p>But what does PredPol actually do? How does it actually work? PredPol
 is a software program that uses proprietary algorithms (modeled after 
equations used to determine earthquake aftershocks) to determine where 
and when crimes will occur based on data sets of past crimes. In Santa 
Cruz, California, one of the pilot cities to first use PredPol, the 
company used eleven years of local crime data to make predictions. In 
police departments that use PredPol, officers are given printouts of 
jurisdiction maps that are covered with red square boxes that indicate 
where crime is supposed to occur throughout the day. Officers are 
supposed to periodically patrol the boxes marked on the map in the hopes
 of either catching criminals or deterring potential criminals from 
committing crimes. The box is a kind of <em>temporary crime zone</em>: a
 geospatial area generated by mathematical models that are unknown to 
average police officers who are not privy to the algorithms, though they
 may have access to the data that is used to make the predictions.</p>

<p>What is the attitude or mentality of the officers who are patrolling 
one of the boxes? When they enter one of the boxes, do they expect to 
stumble upon a crime taking place? How might the expectation of finding 
crime influence what the officers actually find? Will people who pass 
through these temporary crime zones while they are being patrolled by 
officers automatically be perceived as suspicious? Could merely passing 
through one of the red boxes constitute probable cause? Some of these 
questions have already been asked by critics of PredPol. As Nick 
O’Malley notes in an article on PredPol, “Civil rights groups are taking
 [this] concern seriously because designating an area a crime hot spot 
can be used as a factor in formulating ‘reasonable suspicion’ for 
stopping a suspect.”<span id="footnote-10-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="10">10</span></p>

<p>When the Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann arrived on the 
scene on November 22, 2014, it took him less than two seconds to fatally
 shoot Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old black boy who was playing with a 
toy gun. This raises the question—if law enforcement officers are 
already too trigger-happy, will the little red boxes that mark temporary
 crime zones reduce the reaction time of officers while they’re in the 
designated boxes? How does labeling a space as an area where crime will 
occur affect how police interact with those spaces? Although PredPol 
conceptualizes the terrain that is being policed as a field where 
natural events occur, the way that data is interpreted and visualized is
 not a neat reflection of empirical reality; rather, data visualization 
actively <em>constructs </em>our reality.</p>

<p>Furthermore, how might civilians experience passing through one of 
the boxes? If I were to one day find myself in an invisible red box with
 an officer, I might have an extra cause for fear, or at least I would 
be conscious of the fact that I might be perceived as suspicious. But 
given that I am excluded from knowledge of where and when the red boxes 
will emerge, I cannot know when I might find myself in one of these 
temporary crime zones. Using methods that are inscrutable to citizens 
who do not have access to law enforcement knowledge and infrastructure, 
PredPol is remaking and rearranging the space through which we move. 
That is the nature of algorithmic policing; the phenomenological 
experience of policing is qualitatively different from “repressive” 
policing, which takes place on a terrain that is visible and uses 
methods that can be scrutinized and contested. Predictive policing may 
induce a sense of being watched at all times by an eye we cannot see. If
 Jeremy Bentham’s eighteenth-century design of the “panopticon” is the 
architectural embodiment of Michel Foucault’s conception of disciplinary
 power, then algorithmic policing represents the inscription of 
disciplinary power across the entire terrain that is being policed.</p>

<h2>False Positives</h2>

<p>Given the difficulty of measuring the efficacy of predictive policing
 methods, there is a risk of falsely associating “positive” law 
enforcement outcomes with the use of predictive policing software such 
as PredPol. The literature on PredPol is also fuzzy on the question of 
how to measure its success. When police officers are dispatched to the 
five-hundred-by-five-hundred feet square boxes marked in red on city 
maps, are they expected to catch criminals in the act of committing 
crimes, or are they supposed to deter crime with their presence? The 
former implies that an increase in arrests in designated areas would be a
 benchmark of success, while the latter implies that a decrease in crime
 is proof of the software’s efficacy. However, both outcomes have been 
used to validate the success of PredPol. A news clip from its official 
YouTube account narrates the story of how the Norcross Police Department
 (Georgia) caught two burglars in the act of breaking into a house. 
Similarly, an article about PredPol published on Officer.com opens with 
the following anecdote: “Recently a Santa Cruz, Calif. police officer 
noticed a suspicious subject lurking around parked cars. When the 
officer attempted to make contact, the subject ran. The officer gave 
chase; when he caught the subject he learned he was a wanted parolee. 
Because there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, the subject was
 taken to jail.”<span id="footnote-11-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="11">11</span></p>

<p>Much of the literature PredPol uses for marketing offers similarly 
mystical accounts of the software’s clairvoyant capacity to predict 
crime, and these are substantiated by anecdotes about officers stumbling
 upon criminals in the act of committing these crimes. However, PredPol 
consistently claims that its efficacy can be measured by a decrease in 
crime. Yet across the country, crime rates have been plummeting since 
the mid-1990s. In some cases, the company tries to take credit for crime
 reduction by implying there is a causal relationship between the use of
 PredPol and a decrease in crime rates, sometimes without explicitly 
making the claim. In an article linked on PredPol’s website, the author 
notes, “When Santa Cruz implemented the predictive policing software in 
2011, the city of nearly 60,000 was on pace to hit a record number of 
burglaries. But by July burglaries were down 27 percent when compared 
with July 2010.”<span id="footnote-12-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="12">12</span>
 Yet crime rates fluctuate from year to year, and it is impossible to 
parse which factors can be credited with reducing crime. Though the 
article does not explicitly attribute the crime reduction to PredPol, it
 implicitly links the use of PredPol to the 27 percent burglary 
reduction by juxtaposing the two separate occurrences—the adoption of 
PredPol and the decrease in burglaries—so as to construct a presumed 
causal relation. The article goes on to use explanations made by Zach 
Friend (about why and how PredPol works) to validate its efficacy. 
Friend is described as “a crime analyst with the Santa Cruz PD”; 
however, Friend actually left the Santa Cruz Police Department to become
 one of the main lobbyists for PredPol soon after the company was 
founded.</p>

<p>By scrutinizing the PR circuits that link researchers like UCLA’s 
Brantingham to the police, and link Silicon Valley investors to the 
media, one realizes that essentially all claims about the efficacy of 
PredPol loop back to the company itself. Though PredPol’s website 
advertises “scientifically proven field results,” no disinterested third
 party has ever substantiated the company’s claims. What’s even more 
troubling is that PredPol offered 50 percent discounts on the software 
to police departments that agreed to participate as “showcase cities” in
 PredPol’s pilot program. The program required collaboration with the 
company for three years and required police departments to provide 
testimonials that could be used to market the software. For instance, <em>SF Weekly </em>notes that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the city of Alhambra, just northeast of Los Angeles, purchased 
PredPol’s software in 2012 for $27,500. The contract between Alhambra 
and PredPol includes numerous obligations requiring Alhambra to carry 
out marketing and promotion on PredPol’s behalf. Alhambra’s police and 
public officials must “provide testimonials, as requested by PredPol,” 
and “provide referrals and facilitate introductions to other agencies 
who can utilize the PredPol tool.”<span id="footnote-13-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="13">13</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In “The Difference Prevention Makes: Regulating Preventive Justice,” 
David Cole describes five major risks that come with the adoption of the
 “paradigm of prevention” in law enforcement. He notes that “it is not 
just that we cannot know the efficacy of prevention; our assessments are
 likely to be systematically skewed.”<span id="footnote-14-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="14">14</span>
 Others have raised similar concerns with PredPol. According to 
O’Malley, “The American Criminal Law Review has raised concerns the 
program could warp crime statistics, either by increasing the arrest 
rate in the boxes through extra policing or falsely reducing it through 
diffusion.”<span id="footnote-15-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="15">15</span></p>

<h2>The Politics of Crime Data</h2>

<p>Crime has never been a neutral category. What counts as crime, who 
gets labeled criminal, and which areas are policed have historically 
been racialized. Brantingham, the anthropologist who helped create 
PredPol, noted, “The focus on time and location data—rather than the 
personal demographics of criminals—potentially reduces any biases 
officers might have with regard to suspects’ race or socioeconomic 
status.” Though it is true that PredPol is a spatialized form of 
predictive policing that does not target individuals or generate heat 
lists, spatial algorithmic policing, even when it does not use race to 
make predictions, can facilitate racial profiling by calculating proxies
 for race, such as neighborhood and location. Furthermore, predictive 
models are only as good as the data sets they use to make predictions, 
so it is important to interrogate <em>who </em>collects data and <em>how </em>it
 is collected. Although data has been conceptualized as neutral bits of 
information about our world and our behaviors, in the domain of criminal
 justice, it is a reflection of who has been targeted for surveillance 
and policing. If someone commits a crime in an area that is not heavily 
policed—such as on Wall Street or in the white suburbs—it will fail to 
generate any data. PredPol’s reliance on the dirty data collected by the
 police may create a feedback loop that leads to the ossification of 
racialized police practices. Furthermore, when applied to predictive 
policing, the idea that “more data is better,” in that it would improve 
accuracy and efficiency, justifies dragnet surveillance and the 
expansion of policing and carceral operations that generate data.</p>

<p>Though PredPol presents itself as race-neutral, its treatment of 
crime as an objective force that operates according to laws that govern 
natural phenomena, such as earthquake aftershocks—and not as a socially 
constructed category that has meaning only in a specific social 
context—ignores the a priori racialization of crime, and specifically 
the association of crime with blackness. Historian Khalil Gibran 
Muhammad’s <em>The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime and the Making of Modern America </em>traces
 how “at the dawn of the twentieth century, in a rapidly 
industrializing, urbanizing, and demographically shifting America, 
blackness was refashioned through crime statistics. It became a more 
stabilizing racial category in opposition to whiteness through racial 
criminalization.”<span id="footnote-16-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="16">16</span>
 Muhammad describes how data was used primarily by social scientists in 
the North to make the conflation of blackness and criminality appear 
objective and empirically sound, thus justifying a number of antiblack 
social practices such as segregation, racial violence, and penal 
confinement. The consolidation of this “scientific” notion of black 
criminality also enabled formerly criminalized immigrant 
populations—such as the Polish, Irish, and Italians—to be assimilated 
into the category of whiteness. As black Americans were pathologized by 
statistical discourse, the public became increasingly sympathetic to the
 problems of European ethnic groups, and white ethnic participation in 
criminal activities was attributed to structural inequalities and 
poverty, as opposed to personal shortcomings or innate inferiority. 
According to Mohammad, the 1890 census laid much of the groundwork for 
this ideology. He describes how statistics about higher rates of 
imprisonment among black Americans, particularly in northern 
penitentiaries, were “analyzed and interpreted as definitive proof of 
blacks’ true criminal nature.”<span id="footnote-17-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="17">17</span> Thus, biological and cultural racism was eventually supplanted by statistical racism.</p>

<p>While the methods developed by PredPol themselves are not explicitly 
racialized, they are implicitly racialized insofar as geography is a 
proxy for race. Furthermore, given that crime has historically been 
racialized, taking crime for granted as a neutral—or rather, <em>natural</em>—category
 around which to organize predictive policing practices is likely to 
reproduce racist patterns of policing. As PredPol relies on data about 
where previous crimes have occurred, and as police are more likely to 
police neighborhoods that are primarily populated by people of color (as
 well as target people of color for searches and arrests), then the data
 itself that PredPol relies on is systematically skewed. By presenting 
its methods as objective and racially neutral, PredPol veils how the 
data and the categories it relies on are already shaped by structural 
racism.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The story of policing in the twenty-first century cannot be reduced 
to the stereotypical image of bellicose, meathead officers looking for 
opportunities to catch bad guys and to flaunt their institutional power.
 As Donnie Fowler, the PredPol director of business development, was 
quoted saying in the <em>Silicon Valley Business Journal</em>, twenty-first-century policing could more accurately be described as “a story about nerds and cops.”<span id="footnote-18-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="18">18</span>
 However, more than a story of an unlikely marriage between 
data-crunching professors and crime-fighting officers, the story of 
algorithmic policing, and PredPol in particular, is also a story of 
intimate collaboration between domestic law enforcement, the university,
 Silicon Valley, and the media. It is a story of a form of 
techno-governance that operates at the intersection between knowledge 
and power. Yet the numerical and data-driven approach embodied by 
PredPol has been taken up in a number of domains. In both finance and 
policing, there has been a turn toward technical solutions to the 
problem of uncertainty, solutions that attempt to manage risk using 
complex and opaque mathematical models. Yet, although the language of 
risk has replaced the language of race, both algorithmic policing and 
risk-adjusted finance merely code racial inequality as risk. It is 
important that we pay attention to this paradigm shift, as once the 
“digital carceral infrastructure” is built up, it will be nearly 
impossible to undo, and the automated carceral surveillance state will 
spread out across the terrain, making greater and greater intrusions 
into our everyday lives.<span id="footnote-19-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="19">19</span>
 Not only will the “smart” state have more granular knowledge of our 
movements and activities, but as the carceral state becomes more 
automated, it will increase its capacity to process ever-greater numbers
 of people, even when budgets remain stagnant or are cut.</p>

<p>Though it is necessary to acknowledge the invisible, algorithmic (or 
“cybernetic”) underside of policing, it is important to recognize that 
algorithmic policing has not supplanted repressive policing, but is its 
corollary. “Soft control” has not replaced hard forms of control. Police
 have become more militarized than ever as a result of the $34 billion 
in federal grants that have been given to domestic police departments by
 the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of 9/11. While 
repressive policing attempts to respond to events that have already 
occurred, algorithmic policing attempts to maintain law and order by 
actively preventing crime. Yet is it possible that the latter actually 
creates a situation that leads to the multiplication of threats rather 
than the achievement of safety? As predictive policing practices are 
taken up by local police departments across the country, perhaps we 
might consider the extent to which, as Tiqqun writes, “the control 
society is a paranoid society.”<span id="footnote-20-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="20">20</span></p>

											<p>Infused with an adverbial ideal of acting, feeling, and 
thinking modeled on the experience of an electric shock, the modern 
individual who struggles to escape gentrification is indeed no longer 
moved by what remains the same. They have lost their interest in fixed 
identities; what does not vary receives scant notice: an indefinitely 
repeated act, typical of the standardized world of work, seems 
intolerable to them. The very idea of eternity makes them yawn; marble 
leaves them cold. Everything that denies life and the musical variations
 that compose it breeds impatience: perfection and the absolute appear 
to them like an ontological flaw, an inability to become something else,
 the result of a serious intensity deficiency. The supreme objects of 
religious contemplation and wisdom strike them as extraordinarily 
flimsy. They love music for the changes, with repetition a taste of hell
 to come. Like Kierkegaard’s hero, they demand the possible or else they
 suffocate, and not only then; as soon as they are forced to recognize 
what they know, they gasp for air. What stays the same makes no 
difference to them. They need either less or more. They would rather 
change their mind even if the outcome is uncertain than stick to 
established certainties. Endlessly curious, they are ready to taste pain
 just as much as pleasure, as long as there is some change and movement,
 and the sound of being alive—melodious or dissonant—can be heard.</p>

											<p>When the Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann arrived
 on the scene on November 22, 2014, it took him less than two seconds to
 fatally shoot Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old black boy who was playing 
with a toy gun. This raises the question—if law enforcement officers are
 already too trigger-happy, will the little red boxes that mark 
temporary crime zones reduce the reaction time of officers while they’re
 in the designated boxes? How does labeling a space as an area where 
crime will occur affect how police interact with those spaces? Although 
PredPol conceptualizes the terrain that is being policed as a field 
where natural events occur, the way that data is interpreted and 
visualized is not a neat reflection of empirical reality; rather, data 
visualization actively constructs our reality.</p>

											<p>Blaccelerationism posits that there is no need for 
reclamation. A specific tradition of black radical thought has long 
claimed the inhumanity—or we could say anti-humanism—of blackness as a 
fundamental and decisive feature, and philosophically part of blackness’
 gift to the world. Blaccelerationism also draws little distinction 
between a black acceleration and an afrofuturism. Instead it sees them 
as siblings and coconspirators. Masterworks of black art and culture 
that have been labeled examples of afrofuturism often participate 
equally in a blacceleration toward the end of the world. To give just 
one example: Busta Rhymes’s suite of apocalyptic albums (The Coming, 
When Disaster Strikes, E.L.E (Extinction Level Event): The Final World 
Front, and Anarchy) are often called afrofuturist for their exploration 
of a near-future techno-apocalypse and their warped, cyborgian 
accompanying visuals. However, by putting the black man at the center of
 the apocalypse—as both the agent of the world’s demise and its 
inheritor—these works resonate more specifically with the child of these
 strange bedfellows, black radical thought and accelerationism, that I 
call blaccelerationism.</p>

revolutionary project are formed. This is the reality on which the 
vanguard must focus its attention if it wants to establish a tactical 
proposal. The radical transformation of revolutionary tactics, dictated 
by Lenin beginning in April 1917, is not, therefore, some artist’s 
gesture, but the political recognition of hegemonic maturity, of the 
strategic capacity of the proletarian masses (the peasants, workers, and
 soldiers organized into soviets) to seize power.</p>

											<p>Agents of artistic circulation mistake the decision to 
withdraw one’s labor or participation for idle disengagement. The 
illusion of political agency granted by global artistic circulation 
underpins this ideology. In contrast to these false accusations, 
striking art workers engage in artistic self-organization, the highest 
form of social creativity, which produces new social assemblages that 
sustain artistic creativity beyond its ossified forms. Only when 
reinvigorated by strikes, boycotts, and occupations do institutions of 
the commons emerge and provide ground for art as a practice of freedom. 
Far from destroying circulation, the refusal of art workers in moments 
of productive withdrawal allows for its resumption at some point in the 
future and under better terms. Without moments of collective refusal, 
there would be nothing to circulate under the name of art but luxurious 
objects, emptied of sense and value.</p>

											<p>My taxonomy of images of alterity from the twentieth 
century—ethnographic, militant, and witness—is not opposed but rather 
transversal to Rancière’s. What I am interested in, firstly, is tracking
 the kinds of discourses underlying images of Western alterity in the 
aftermath of the postcolonial critique of the ethnographic image, the 
demise of the third-worldist militant image, and the exposure of the 
limitations of the witness image, which often serves to perpetuate the 
figure of the “victim.” These visibilities have perhaps become the 
“visual” in Daney’s sense. Second, I wish to consider the possibility of
 an image of soulèvement—in the sense of an image of an other that could
 threaten Western imperialism and capitalist absolutism, a system this 
is consensually driven by the desire and need for visibility, and that 
legitimates social Darwinism with racism and misogynist speech in the 
public sphere.</p>

											<p>At first, I thought “performative” was coined by dance 
people in order to sound like museum people. But then I realized that 
the art world’s misuse of this term predates the dance world’s. Which 
made way more sense but also bummed me out even further. Why would 
dancemakers do this to ourselves? Why would we let museums rename what 
it is we already do? And why would we ourselves then use that language 
to describe what we have already been doing all these years? I long to 
see the dance world assert its language as part of its commodity. If you
 want to present dance, you need to know how to talk in dance’s existing
 language. It serves the form just fine because it is of the form. Dance
 doesn’t want to talk about itself from the remove of class or body. 
Dance wants to be hot in the center of its own glory hole—though it will
 happily pee on the museum steps for the right price.</p>

											<p>Plato seeks to explain beauty only in terms of its effect,
 but beauty is supposed to be nothing but the imitation of the idea of 
beauty—this seemingly merely exegetic remark on the Plato passage is, if
 I am not mistaken, of the most central imaginable significance for the 
establishment of an aesthetics. For it means that neither can we explain
 the idea of beauty or the idea of art as such in directly objectivist 
terms—that is to say, without reflection on the spirit, without 
reflection on humans and their attitude towards objectivity—nor, on the 
other hand, is this idea of art or this idea of beauty limited to the 
context of effects that it imposes on us; rather, it is essentially 
objective and has an objective aspect. In other words: if I could 
already formulate here the polarity which one encounters in Plato, if 
one does not wish crudely to impose an inconsistent theory on him, one 
must say that the underlying conception of beauty itself here is a 
dialectical conception of beauty. This means that beauty itself, by its 
own nature, presents itself as mediated, inherently as something like a 
tension between subjective and objective aspects. And when I told you 
that all the motifs of aesthetics that ever unfolded in later times are 
already present here, as if in a kind of sacred foundational text, then 
this is primarily what I had in mind. For even at its highest peak, at 
the Hegelian peak, aesthetic speculation did not get any further than 
that definition of beauty which termed beauty itself—instead of calling 
it being in a static, object-like sense—just such a state of tension 
between subjective and objective aspects.</p>

											<p>Some scenes you never return from the morbid imagining of,
 like the love song of Martin Heidegger and Hannah Arendt, even if you 
know that neither the task of universal good nor the project of 
demolishing evil (including current evil) will be moved ahead a 
millimeter by morbid fantasies. I need to figure out what to do with my 
treasured, honed perversity and the tradition (from the Marquis de Sade 
through Genet, Hervé Guibert, and Foucault) that celebrates perversity 
and finds revolutionary seeds in it. What will you do with those seeds 
right now? Are they stale in the hand? Will perversity help us now?</p>
