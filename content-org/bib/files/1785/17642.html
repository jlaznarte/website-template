	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<br>
	<div>Pollen recognition has a wide range of industrial and scientific 
applications. It guides the energy industry to potential oil and gas 
deposits, it is proxy data for climate-change scien- tists, and it 
increases agricultural production. However, pollen recognition is time 
consuming because it is usually done by visual inspection. Current 
automated solutions rely on pre-designed measurements of texture and 
contours, which require tuning for optimal features of a dataset. Also, 
most methods classify pollen using single-focus images, which require 
pollen grains to be captured at specific focal planes. We take a 
difference approach. Instead of using single-focus images, we use stacks
 of multifocal images (i.e., z-stack) to account for both visual 
characteristics and 3-D information. We automatically learn from the 
data the best visual characteristics for classifying pollen using 
deep-learning methods. Here, we train convolutional and recurrent neural
 networks (CNN and RNN) to learn the optimal features and recognize a 
pollen grain as a sequence of multifocal images acquired by an optical 
microscope. Additionally, we transfer the knowledge pre-trained network 
to ours to improve its classification and convergence speed. We 
evaluated our method using 392 stack sequences of 10 types of pollen 
grains with 10 images for each sequence. Our method achieved a 
remarkable classi- fication rate of 100%.</div>
