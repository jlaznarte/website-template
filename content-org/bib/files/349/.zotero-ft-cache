Abstract

A preliminary assessment carried out in Madrid demonstrates the difficulty of compliance with the new European PM 10 tolerances. Daily and annual limiting values would be exceeded at almost all the network stations under the terms of the directive's second stage. An experimental study, based on the chemical characterisation of the PM 10 and PM 2.5 fractions sampled at a representative urban site, provides the major mass contents of these two fractions. These are mainly related to two different particle sources: combustion processes including traffic emissions and mineral-origin particles. Nonmineral carbon is the major component of particulate matter in this region, mostly in the PM 2.5 fraction, increasing its contribution in wintertime. The second largest component identified in the PM 10 mass, is associated with crustal origin particles and is more relevant in summer, whereas the second largest contributor to PM 2.5 is secondary particles.

In general, PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations show good agreement with traffic-related pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and CO, being time-correlated in winter pollution episodes. PM 1 and PM 2.5 have been simultaneous and continuously measured indicating road transport as the main source of these finer fractions. Mineral contribution has been mainly identified in the coarser particles associated with dust resuspension and some long-range transport events of Saharan dust, although they are also present in the finer PM 2.5 fraction.

1. Introduction

As a result of the recently approved European directive on air quality (99/30/CE), new limiting values for several atmospheric pollutants must be met by 2005 and 2010. Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 μm (PM 10 ) will be henceforth the parameter used for measuring and controlling atmospheric pollution by airborne particles. In addition, although the reference method for PM 2.5 (aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) is not yet established and consequently no limiting values have been approved for this fraction, its measurement is at present required in the European Union at representative sites. These sites should coincide, wherever possible, with the PM 10 sampling points.

The Spanish regulations in force up to 2002, applied to total suspended particles (TSP), which resulted in extremely high limits when compared to annual and daily limiting values established by the Directive for PM 10 , which are to be achieved in the first instance by 2005, and even higher than the more stringent requirements of the second stage in 2010.

In a preliminary assessment, based on 1995–1998 PM 10 data, the Madrid urban network satisfactorily fulfilled the Spanish regulations at that time, but the situation with respect to the new Directive appeared to be rather critical (Artı́ñano et al., 2001) . Regarding the annual average, 20% of the stations would have exceeded the limit established for the first phase (40 μg m −3 ), and 80% of the network stations would have been above the upper limit (20 μg m −3 ) envisaged for the second phase. The situation was even worst in terms of the daily tolerance (50 μg m −3 ), and 80% of stations would have exceeded the limit for a number of days beyond that allowed by either stage of the directive (35 and 7 days, respectively).

In conclusion, this survey pointed out that severe control measures should be taken to diminish atmospheric particle levels in the urban area. But the emission of atmospheric particles, as recent European reports on air quality reveal (APEG, 1999) , seems to be a general problem that not only affects Madrid's citizens, but almost 80% of the European population, who will be exposed to exceedances of the PM 10 standards (EEA, 2000) in the near future.

Road transport is known to be one of the main sources of urban pollution, although other sources also linked to combustion processes, such as domestic-residential and institutional heating, also contribute to significant pollutant emissions in urban areas. Road transport in the Madrid region is roughly responsible for 80% of CO and NO x and more than 50% of nonmethane hydrocarbon(NMHC) emissions ( MIMAM, 1996 ).

The car fleet in Madrid came to 2.5 million vehicles in 2000, of which more than 80% were passenger cars. The number of vehicles circulating through the capital's streets and main motorways of the metropolitan area every working day has been estimated to be 1.8×10 6 units. Of these, 83% have petrol engines, whereas the remaining 17% use diesel as fuel (Palacios, 2001) . Unlike other European countries, diesel may be used for both private and public transport.

The most recent European and national atmospheric emission figures make great efforts to introduce TSP, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , or even PM 0.1 emissions in terms of mass. Although thorough studies and reviews deal with secondary and natural sources QUARG, 1996  and  APEG, 1999 , most of them only consider primary sources or anthropogenic particles (Berdowski et al., 1996) . This is due to the uncertainties and difficulties still associated with emission factors for some source categories, particularly road transport, which cannot be scaled up or are country-specific. Some of the latest and more extensive applied methodologies used to estimate road transport emissions (Ntziachristos and Samaras, 2000) in Europe only consider primary emission of total atmospheric particles, which are commonly assumed to be PM 10 . As experimental emission figures obtained for diesel powered vehicles are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those for petrol engine vehicles (Berdowski et al., 1996) , most figures only consider PM 10 emissions from diesel engines. This implies neglecting the contribution of the remaining cars, which can significantly contribute to the levels of particles, especially if secondary particles are to be considered. Primary particle emissions from road transport resulting from tyre and brake wear and dust resuspension are often neglected. Emissions are lower when compared to direct vehicle exhausts, but their sum can give rise to an underestimation of PM 10 emissions from road transport in the current figures. PM 2.5 emission figures are less frequent and subject to even larger uncertainty.

The absence of reliable and suitable emission figures from road transport in many countries, and other uncertainties associated with road traffic, makes particulate matter an important issue, and this is a matter of concern to air quality managers in most cities of the world. Recent European Community policies, such as unleaded petrol consumption or the use of more efficient vehicles, have been aimed at decreasing emissions due to road transport. However, the continuously increasing number of vehicles, perhaps due to the centralisation of big cities and new social patterns and habits, obscures the efficiency of these technical measures.

This work analyses the average PM 10 values and seasonal evolution of the Madrid air quality network during the past few years. It summarises the results of the chemical composition of the PM 10 and PM 2.5 fractions sampled during an experimental study conducted at a representative traffic-influenced urban site. The main components of these fractions differed and evolved in different ways, allowing an investigation of the contribution of five main particle sources at the site. Traffic influence on atmospheric particulate matter is relevant but mineral contribution should also be taken into account. The PM 2.5 /PM 10 and PM 1 /PM 2.5 ratios are analysed in terms of traffic and the influence of other natural particle sources.
2. Methodology
2.1. The Madrid air quality network

The air quality network of this city consists of 25 stations covering all of the municipal districts and specific areas of main interest. They are all urban and traffic-oriented stations, except for one that is located on the outskirts of the city in a large park. This site is in an open place with no traffic thoroughfares in the vicinity. Thus, from this point of view, it can be considered to be an urban background station, Casa de Campo, #24 (Fig. 1) . The other monitoring stations are placed at major junctions, squares, or main roads in the city; the distance to the kerb not being greater than 15 m in all cases.
