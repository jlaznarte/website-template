        Moving Wall: 5 years (What is the moving wall?)

        Moving Wall

            The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal. Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication.
            Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted.
            For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available.

            Terms Related to the Moving Wall
                Fixed walls: Journals with no new volumes being added to the archive.
                Absorbed: Journals that are combined with another title.
                Complete: Journals that are no longer published or that have been combined with another title.

Page 298 of Air Pollution from Truck Traffic and Lung Function in Children Living near Motorways

Abstract
The contribution of motorized traffic to air pollution is widely recognized, but relatively few studies have looked at the respiratory health status of subjects living near busy roads. We studied children in six areas located near major motorways in the Netherlands. We measured lung function in the children, and we assessed their exposure to traffic-related air pollution using separate traffic counts for automobiles and trucks. We also measured air pollution in the children's schools. Lung function was associated with truck traffic density but had a lesser association with automobile traffic density. The association was stronger in children living closest (<300 m) to the motorways. Lung function was also associated with the concentration of black smoke, measured inside the schools, as a proxy for diesel exhaust particles. The associations were stronger in girls than in boys. The results indicate that exposure to traffic-related air pollution, in particular diesel exhaust particles, may lead to reduced lung function in children living near major motorways.
