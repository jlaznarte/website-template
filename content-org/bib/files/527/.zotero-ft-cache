This paper discusses a general approach towards integrating dynamic limits in the operation and planning activities of a network operator. The global view looks at all the factors potentially limiting power transfers between congested zones or limiting distributed generation injections from renewable energy resources. The need is recognized for a systematic approach with centralized limit management to take full advantage of DLR.
