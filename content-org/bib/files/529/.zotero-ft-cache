Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), a.k.a determining the maximum rating of overhead lines based on real-time weather parameters has the potential to significantly increase the power transport & distribution capacity of the grid in favorable weather conditions. Combining active network management (curtailable generation) with DLR as trigger offers a solution out-there for the system operator that combines technical feasibility, adequate implementation timing and economic viability. Flexible generation being already in use on the ELIA network, the potential benefits of using it in conjunction with DLR will be analyzed.
