Research study on stored apples for period of sixmonth was conducted on three different export varieties of apples such as Golden delicious, Red delicious and Granny smith. The mechanical properties determined were modulus of elasticity, failure stress, failure strain, failure energy and toughness. A three factorial split plot experiment in a randomized block design with nine replications were conducted. Modulus of elasticity, failure stress, failure strain, failure energy and toughness were determined for Golden delicious, Red delicious and Granny smith in different month from November, December, January, February, and March to April There was a significant difference among the first and last month of all the parameters. Granny smith properties were higher than the other two varieties. Golden delicious had higher strain than other two varieties. Storage period had significant effect on the mechanical properties as confirmed by Abbot and Lu (1996). Apples over period of storage will lose their strength as reported by Mohsenin et al. (1962). Storage had highest effect on the failure energy and least effect on the modulus of elasticity. Golden delicious mechanical properties had decreased sharply than other variety over first couple month of the storage and especially last month of storage. However Red delicious and Granny smith had almost uniform variation from first to last month of storage. An analysis of variance on variety, time of test series, and interaction between them on all the mechanical properties mentioned above at 1 % probability level had shown significantly different. A Duncan multiple mean comparison test for all three varieties at 5 % probability level had shown significant differences among the parameters. Sampling position in all three varieties was not significant on all the parameters.

</span></a><font class="DBSommaireTexteSource"> - (13-9-2005) </font></td></tr><tr><td width="3%"></td><td width="80%" height="3"><p class="DBSommaireTexteAbstract">We are at present living a very special historical process of technological change, which was brought about by the development and widespread use of the new information and communication technologies (from here on ICT). This process began as a technological system in the seventies in U.S. research and technology centres, spreading rapidly over the past quarter of a century, first, to the military industry and large industrial corporations, then, to the smaller and medium-sized firms, offices and collective services, and more recently, in the last decade, to our households. Fig. 1 shows a chronological outline of the adoption of these technologies. It is a process of generation and adoption of innovations based on ICT, and so spectacular that no precedent exists in the history of humanity, except perhaps in the changes that took place during the industrial revolution and the later ones of electrification and the appearance of the automobile. In the last century, the continual technological changes demand constant institutional and organisational innovations; and today, as then, these changes have a strong bearing on the economic and sociocultural structure of society, leading to what was initially called the post-industrial society, and which today is known, in an ever more widespread manner, as the information society. One feature of the information society is that it promotes globalisation. Another characteristic, clearly related to the former, is that it tends to favour a network-type organisation of economic and social relations among people and organisations. Because of these two characteristics it can be affirmed that the new information society is global in scope, but is organised locally; that is, it is built upon the local. Under these circumstances, if we take into account that the ICT also further the production and labour flexibility typical of the post-Ford production model in use today, it is easy to conclude that these technologies open up a vast horizon of varied opportunities (new products, new services, new management and organisational methods, new jobs, etc.) and constitute the ideal tool to optimise the exploitation of endogenous resources in rural communities, which, thanks to these new technologies, will free themselves from many of the limitations that hinder their development: isolation, low population density, market remoteness, inaccessibility, all of which limit the creation of business initiatives, and maintain education and training of the local community at low levels. The impact ICT can have on Rural Development is, consequently, enormous. We present here some thoughts regarding the possibilities and the limitations of the use of ICT in rural development processes. To this end, after a few very short commentaries of a theoretical and conceptual nature on the implication of ICT in the local development of rural areas, we advance some ideas about the 1208 possibilities that their use provides, and describe the phases of their implementation in the development process, in order to identify and comment on several of the blocking factors that could impede this integration. Finally in closing, some conclusions of a strategic nature are drawn about what the local development agents and public administrations can do.

</span></a><font class="DBSommaireTexteSource"> - (13-9-2005) </font></td></tr><tr><td width="3%"></td><td width="80%" height="3"><p class="DBSommaireTexteAbstract">The emerging trend in the literature is an acknowledgment that no single approach to rural service delivery will satisfy the needs of all natural resource users. Rural resources users are grouped broadly into farm families with access to markets, rural communities with diversified livelihoods that include on-farm income, and communities that access common property resources -pastures, watershed, forests- as part of their livelihoods. Each group has very distinct needs, and in many cases privatized systems leave out those that are least able to link to markets. The potential of alternative systems is explored with a theoretical foundation based on systems thinking, knowledge systems, as well as the applied fields of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and communication for development. The paper projects three complementary types of service delivery levels that respond to three broad natural resource groups: farmers with access to markets, subsistence households with migrant family members, and community organizations and federations. For each of these groups, the scenarios address the level of analysis and action, service delivery levels, the nature of the information sought, and the communication functions that best respond to each group's needs. A second projection describes several ICT demand and supply issues that require clarification for each major group of stakeholders. A third projection describes the strategic planning dimension, with emphasis on the characteristics of the outcomes and outputs in terms of natural resource and information and communication. The paper closes with a review of the principles that may help guide the design of the different targeted delivery systems.

</span></a><font class="DBSommaireTexteSource"> - (13-9-2005) </font></td></tr><tr><td width="3%"></td><td width="80%" height="3"><p class="DBSommaireTexteAbstract">Phoma stem canker (Leptosphaeria maculans) is one of the main diseases that affect oilseed rape worldwide. It is important to use reliable methods to describe the disease which is often characterised by the visual assessment of the severity of cankers created by the pathogen at the bottom of the stems. In order to maintain standardisation of assessment keys, a rating scale has recently been developed in France. However, like many other rating systems for disease severity, the inter-rater reliability has to be improved. A computer-aided training program, named Phomadidacte, has been developed to tackle this question. The basic principle of this program consists in having a user rate a number of pictures of cankered cross-sections that had previously been rated by a set of experts. Those two sets of disease assessments, are then compared for discrepancies. At the end of a training session, the program either suggests that the user keeps on training or declares a good match between the experts' and the user's ratings, based on two thresholds: the percentage of pictures correctly rated and the percentage of pictures for which the rate given by the user and the expert differ by more than one severity grade. At the end, a graph summarising the differences between the user's and the experts' grades is displayed and an ASCII file containing the data of the session is created. The user can then browse all the pictures to compare the grade that he or she gave with the experts' grade. An online version of Phomadidacte is also available. A "before and after training test" for one rater is presented in this paper to exemplify the use of Phomadidacte. The method described in this paper to develop such a program is not specific to phoma stem canker and could therefore be successfully applied to other pathosystems.

</span></a><font class="DBSommaireTexteSource"> - (13-9-2005) </font></td></tr><tr><td width="3%"></td><td width="80%" height="3"><p class="DBSommaireTexteAbstract">A holistic stochastic dynamic model was developed by focusing on the interactions between conceptually isolated keycomponents, such as local passerine guilds and changes in habitat conditions, in Mediterranean agroecosystems of the "Terra Quente Transmontana region" (north-eastern Portugal). The ecological integrity of the typical patchwork of this region, with respect to land use, can be partly assessed by the observation of the occurrence of passerine guilds. These important indicators and state variables are the underlying database of our model. This model aimed the prediction of the ecological changes which can be expected when olive orchards are being intensified. The model proposedwas preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure (stepwise multiple regression analysis) performed to discriminate the significant relationships between guild richness and environmental variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of habitat changes. The model parameters were estimated from the results of the stochastic treatment and from regional data regarding tendencies within the use of land. A period of 50 years was considered. The final model provided some basis to analyse the responses of passerine guilds to the environmental scenarios that will characterize the new agroecosystems of the region. The model simulations were incorporated into a Geographical Information System (GIS) approach. The results of the simulation revealed a structural drift within the different guild richness in response to the expected gradient of habitat changes. The possible local extinction of several species within the less well-represented guilds, such as the steppe passerine species, may be associated with a predictable reduction in ecological integrity of the typical agroecosystems. Therefore, a newstructure of the passerine communities indicates that future agroecosystems will diverge from the initial or actual ecological state.

The mathematical models were used as decision support systems when planning future production for the participating farms. Models are aimed at underpinning sustainable dairy genetic improvement programmes. The main goal of investigation was connected with genetic improvement of farm livestock within sustainable dairy farming where further mathematical modelling may improve farm efficiency. Sustainability in animal breeding and reproduction was considered as the extent to which animal breeding and reproduction contribute to maintenance and good care of animal genetic resources for the future generations. Introduction of longevity as a breeding goal trait into Estonian Holstein breeding programme improved the efficiency of dairy system within sustainable dairy farming 16.9%. In Estonia only 5.1% of cows are culled because of low production. The main reasons for short life span of cows were the disorders in functional traits (fertility problems - 23.9%, udder disorders - 26.0%, feet problems - 13.0%). Genetic improvement of the length of production life should improve the genetic structure of the herd, reduce the age at first calving (28.9 months at the moment) and prolong longevity (5 years at the moment). Described methodology by including longevity into breeding goal of cattle enables the breeders to achieve greater genetic progress and profitability in sustainable dairy production system. To improve the efficiency of dissemination of agricultural and rural information and advisory activities an internet portal for rural undertakings and an information dissemination system were launched. The coordinating national centre and county centres help farmers and rural undertakings to find and understand information, and gives the Ministry of Agriculture regular feedback on the information needs of rural undertakings.

However, in the last years the reconversion of the Portuguese orchards has been directed to the plantation of new varieties and to the introduction of new techniques aiming to reduce several limitante factors. This work intends to analyze the behaviour of Glorieta and Ferragn&egrave;s almond varieties and to determine the minimum hydraulic potential that justifies the needs of irrigation. The results suggest that the introduction of irrigation in almond trees can significantly increase the photosynthetic productivity, with a benefit of about 346% for Glorieta and 122% for Ferragn&egrave;s. It was also observed that it was between 9h and 11h that the photosynthesis rate has the higher augments. It is also suggested the importance of an irrigation plan managed by the foliar hydraulic potential, once it was found that under -2.05MPa for Ferragn&egrave;s and -2.50MPa for Glorieta it occurs a 50% reduction on photosynthesis.

There is a real need in information exchange and most of the time implies multiple data entry. The various standardisation initiatives result in limiting, in precise cases, the operations of recaptures but remain partitioned by die of production. The GIEA (Farm information management) project offers an opportunity of semantic and conceptual homogenisation. This project gathers the majority of the farmer's partners. Its objective is to define the ontology of the farm. Methodology, selected technologies as well as the quality of the associated actors open the prospect for a wider ontological definition on the scale of the French agricultural field.

In order to make good management decisions the farmer must manipulate a lot of data. Information technology tools have been used by dairy farmers for a long time but they have become even more important as the market competition and demand for quality increased. Many software applications are available to support dairy farms management. However, most of them cover only a few aspects of the dairy production while it would be desirable to have more comprehensive systems. Due to their proprietary nature information exchange between different software packages is hindered or literally impossible. Component-based software development can help overcame many of the interoperability and scalability problems encountered nowadays. In order to help build a sound foundation for the development of such components it is necessary to go through a detailed analysis of the problem. This paper presents a domain analysis based on the concept of use-cases applied to the dairy production domain. The concept of usecase was adopted because it allowed a clear understanding of the functions that the system should provide from its users point of view. The model includes class diagrams which can be analyzed and understood by the users, since it is based on real-world objects. The model obtained will be used for the development of a component repository for animal production information systems.

Photosynthesis is one of the main processes involved in that exchange, and its quantification is an important step toward understanding the global CO2 balance. This quantification however is hindered by the complexity and non-linearity of the process, which depends on many variables. In order to help address that problem artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to derive a model to calculate photosynthesis in Hymenaea courbaril, an important tropical tree known as "jatoba". This paper presents an evaluation of the results of the photosynthesis modelling comparing different error indices: the mean relative error (MRE), the correlation coefficient (r) and Willmott's coefficient (d). Data with very low photosynthesis values, in the range of -0,099 to 0,099 &micro;mol CO2.m-2.s-1, may occur during the experiment but may be strongly affected by the experimental set-up (equipment calibration, influence of human respiration, etc.). The correlation and Willmott's coefficients were more effective than the mean relative error in the sense that they were less affected by the presence of those unfiltered data. The best results obtained for the modelling showed "r" and "d" coefficients of 0,99, both for full data sets and for filtered data. The mean relative error was more affected by those unfiltered data: its value was 0,18 for data without filtering and 0,07 for filtered data.

Conservation agriculture adopted in the main crop production systems in Brazil has also renewed concerns about soil compaction due to machine traffic. Research on this subject approaches the problem in two ways: estimation of traffic influence on soil physical properties and classification of soil compaction regarding its effects on crop development. The general target is to develop simple and accurate tools for mechanization planning in order to avoid excessive soil compaction and to increase agricultural sustainability. This work presents a methodology to apply fuzzy modeling techniques in soil compaction classification due to machine traffic based on expert knowledge and experimental data. Fuzzy classification model simulates the qualitative relations between compaction classes and soil physical properties, the former identified by cultural profile method. Soil physical properties were represented by fuzzy sets and the qualitative relations between them and compaction classes were represented by linguistic fuzzy rules. The model was developed based on expert knowledge and tested with experimental data. The rate of classification success for each depth (0 to 0,1; 0,1 to 0,2; 0,2 to 0,3 and 0,3 to 0,4 m) was used to evaluate the classification model performance. The results show reasonable performance with high success rate in the soil surface but with medium accuracy in the 0,1-0,2 m layer.

In this context the Brazilian government created the "National Program of Production and Use of Biodiesel" in December of 2004. Inserted in this national program the Federal University of Vi&ccedil;osa and the Ministry of the Agrarian Development has made an agreement to the construction of a software to help the government's technicians in the decisions that has to be taken regarding implantation of producing units of biodiesel. To accomplish its objective the Decision Support System Biodiesel is composed by the two links that constitute the productive chain of the biodiesel: the agricultural and the industrial. The system calculates the economical viability of the activity with the "entrance data" supplied by the user, resulting in several "exit data" as estimative of the production costs, incomes, investments, financings, cash flows, social and financial indicators and sceneries. It is a fast, versatile and solid program, which will bring dynamism to the decisions to be taken by the Brazilian government.

These schemes have field workers that communicate directly with farmers and need to receive from and send information to the associations' head office, namely data on the use of water and the management of the irrigation infrastructure. If the information is collected and dispersed manually then data quality and delivery time issues can arise. Also, because information is normally collected on paper, the processes are slow, expensive and error-prone. Problems like these can significantly impair communication between the organization and the farmers. In this paper we propose a cost-effective information system to facilitate the exchange of data between the association head office and field workers. The system uses a mobile device (PDA) to collect and exchange information with the head office. The field workers can input water supplies on the PDA and send this information directly to the association via GSM without further manual input. The information sent to the head office is automatically integrated with the central information system. The PDA can also download relevant information about farmers and water use, allowing field workers to obtain this information in real time. A prototype of this information system was implemented and is currently being tested by a field worker, concerning ease of use and reliability. The roll-out plan includes a full time pilot on the next water campaign.

Agriculture also seeks to optimize its production systems and the adoption of instrumentation and control plays a big role in this process. As a matter of fact, control networks in agriculture face some of the same problems that are found in the industry. There is a variety of technologies and solutions available that are often proprietary and not interoperable. Different networks require the development of customized sensors and actuators, which raises their cost and complexity, and limits their flexibility and adoption. A standard was developed to overcome these difficulties, proposing a common interface for transducers independent of control networks. This common interface promotes the interchangeability and interoperability of transducers, resulting in improved flexibility and reduced costs. The standard also promotes the development of smart, plug and play sensors and actuators through the specification of Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS). The TEDS allow the automatic identification and configuration of transducers, making it easier to install, maintain and modify the system. This paper presents an overview of the IEEE 1451 - Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors and Actuators - and highlights the benefits that its adoption can bring to agriculture in general. Some issues regarding the standard are raised and its future and perspectives are also discussed. Future works include the development of a greenhouse climate control system based on the IEEE 1451 standard.

Consequently, time devoted to research activities becomes gradually reduced. Implementing specific information systems that assist educational processes and research management may improve the situation while increasing efficiency. In this work Internet applications supporting teaching of agricultural engineering and also research management, were developed. Providing sequential educational materials prepared by agricultural engineering faculty members, the program allows them to verify in various forms students' achievements and to analyze the teaching process. Learning goals as well as verifying tests are based on static and dynamic pictures. Systems implementation was preceded by object modeling in the UML notation. Both latest Internet technological inventions, PHP 5 and ASP.NET, were selected. The two applications work with the SQL Server 2000 database system, supported by an original safety system developed for data confidentiality.

The experimental setup was a completely randomized design. Two potato cultivars (Dark-red Norland and Superior) were simultaneously grown in the growth chamber. Results show that nitrogen deficiency had an impact on fluorescence ratios. 10% and 30% were more easily detected than 60%. There was no major difference between the results of the two cultivars except for the starting date of a significant relation. As Norland is an earlier cultivar a significant difference between N-deficient plants and control plants was detected starting at the 30th days after emergence (DAE) whereas it was detected from the 37 DAE for cv. Superior.

The project's data management should therefore provide user-friendly and efficient ways to submit, store, search, retrieve, transfer, display, link, backup, and archive the information. To this end various methods of information technology (including web interfaces and database software) supply the appropriate tools. In any interdisciplinary context, metadata are a crucial key to comprehensive accessibility and handling the available information. They are indispensable instruments for search, validation and analysis and should contain all important specifications characterising the corresponding primary data set, i.e. information about their origin, content, quality, and other features (e.g. temporal and spatial conditions). This is essential for analysing and integrating data from different sources. The interdisciplinary research project "Land use options for peripheral regions" (SFB 299) developed a metadata management system for handling of research data. The system facilitates different ways to access and present complex and heterogeneous environmental data. The broad spectrum of different types of collected data (tables, species lists, image data, GIS layer, etc.) makes it impractical to rely mainly on standard commercial software. Therefore a specific customized database had to be developed and implemented. This approach proved to be extremely supportive in enhancing the interdisciplinarity and the exchange of research results within the SFB 299 project. Over the past nine years the concept of metadata management has been repeatedly and gradually extended and upgraded to meet the changing requirements of an increasingly complex body of data. It turned out that these growing demands could not have been anticipated at the time when the project started. The system achieves a high level of compatibility and ensures a smooth exchange between different applications because it is restricted to well-accepted open-source standards and requires any data entry to work with a mask-guided metadata input. We implemented a classical client server system, where users can access the database via the internet with all standard web browsers. A graphical interface facilitates the search and compilation of data. The available database features were designed according to the needs of the participating research groups and are constantly adapted to new requirements. This paper reports about the architecture, the implemented technology and the rationale underlying our information system.

Accordingly, the European Council Directive concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (CEC, 1991) has established mandatory controls on the rate and timing of organic and inorganic N applications to farmland within the Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) to reduce water pollution by nitrates. Therefore, specific programs are required for different NVZs limiting the amounts of N applied together with other strategies for preventing N leaching losses. And this is the case for the Portuguese NVZ n&ordm;1: "Freatic Aquifer of Esposende and Vila do Conde" where intensive dairy and horticultural farming systems are dominant. Although the characterization and analysis of the natural and human environment, including local socioeconomic and environmental patterns have been carried out within a Geographical Information System (GIS) for this NVZ, further research is needed to integrate the field work collected databases to develop a framework analytical tool able to clarify the nitrate leaching process at the plot level. During two funded EU technical projects was detailed information about nitrogen fertilizations time and rates, improved irrigation techniques as well, disseminated results and created framers decision making aid tools. With these tools and data new strategies within the action program for this Zone may be suggested to minimize N leaching of nitrates reducing social complains about water quality, as well as environmental damage within the ecosystems and human health

Prior this equipping, there were, among their environment, collective cattle IS that were built during the last decades, mainly for genetic and health collective cattle improvement. The cattle farm IS has to serve the farmer's needs. These two types of IS have different purposes but they have to share many data that concern the cattle and farm management The purpose of this paper is to describe through the French situation, the evolution of the relationship between collective cattle IS and farm IS, their actual articulation, and the resulting perspectives for the IS of both farmers and collective cattle organizations in the future

Archimedes principle was used to experimentally measure volumes (overall, shell and meat). For this, whole oyster, or shell, or meat was weighed in the air and suspended in water. Densities of whole oysters, shells and meat were calculated. Using a machine vision system, the top and side view areas of whole oysters were determined, and using a reference object these were converted to exact areas in cm2. The top view areas of oyster meats were similarly determined. Various simple functions were fit to the view area data to predict the whole oyster volume and weight, and meat volume and weight. Another method to predict whole volume was developed. Oyster top and side view areas were divided into even number of sections, and the cross-sectional area of each was predicted by fitting a cubic spline. These areas were integrated by Simpson's method to calculate volume
