	abstract = {In palynology, the visual classification of pollen grains from different species is a hard task which is usually tackled by human operators using microscopes. Its complete automatization would save a high quantity of resources and provide valuable improvements especially for allergy-related information systems, but also for other application fields as paleoclimate reconstruction, quality control of honey based products, collection of evidences in criminal investigations or fabric dating and tracking. This paper presents three state-of-the-art deep learning classification methods applied to the recently published POLEN23E image dataset. The three methods make use of convolutional neural networks: the first one is strictly based on the idea of transfer learning, the second one is based on feature extraction and the third one represents a hybrid approach, combining transfer learning and feature extraction. The results from the three methods are indeed very good, reaching over 97\% correct classification rates in images not previously seen by the models, where other authors reported around 70.},

A classification-based approach is introduced to forecast the main pollination season, and the proposed method is applied to a range of parameters such as the threshold level, which defines the pollen season, and several forecasting horizons. Different computational intelligence approaches are tested including Random Forests, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. The model allows to predict risk exposures for patients and thus anticipate the activation of preventive measures for clinical institutions.},

	abstract = {Forecasting airborne pollen concentrations is one of the most studied topics in aerobiology, due to its crucial application to allergology. The most used tools for this problem are single lineal regressions and autoregressive models (ARIMA). Notwithstanding, few works have used more sophisticated tools based in Artificial Intelligence, as are neural or neuro-fuzzy models. In this work, we applied some of these models to forecast olive pollen concentrations in the atmosphere of Granada (Spain). We first studied the overall performance of the selected models, then considering the data segmented into intervals (low, medium and high concentration), to test how they behave on each interval. Experimental results show an advantage of the neuro-fuzzy models against classical statistical methods, although there is still room for improvement.1This research has been partially supported by Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología under project TIC2003-04650.1},
