abstract: Forecasting airborne pollen concentrations is one of the most studied topics
  in aerobiology, due to its crucial application to allergology. The most used tools
  for this problem are single lineal regressions and autoregressive models (ARIMA).
  Notwithstanding, few works have used more sophisticated tools based in Artificial
  Intelligence, as are neural or neuro-fuzzy models. In this work, we applied some
  of these models to forecast olive pollen concentrations in the atmosphere of Granada
  (Spain). We first studied the overall performance of the selected models, then considering
  the data segmented into intervals (low, medium and high concentration), to test
  how they behave on each interval. Experimental results show an advantage of the
  neuro-fuzzy models against classical statistical methods, although there is still
  room for improvement.1This research has been partially supported by Ministerio de
  Ciencia y Tecnología under project TIC2003-04650.1
