abstract: In this paper we approach the problem of predicting the start and the end
  dates for the pollen season of grasses (family Poaceae) and plantains (family Plantago)
  in the city of Madrid. A classification-based approach is introduced to forecast
  the main pollination season, and the proposed method is applied to a range of parameters
  such as the threshold level, which defines the pollen season, and several forecasting
  horizons. Different computational intelligence approaches are tested including Random
  Forests, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. The model allows to predict
  risk exposures for patients and thus anticipate the activation of preventive measures
  for clinical institutions.
