abstract: 'In palynology, the visual classification of pollen grains from different
  species is a hard task which is usually tackled by human operators using microscopes.
  Its complete automatization would save a high quantity of resources and provide
  valuable improvements especially for allergy-related information systems, but also
  for other application fields as paleoclimate reconstruction, quality control of
  honey based products, collection of evidences in criminal investigations or fabric
  dating and tracking. This paper presents three state-of-the-art deep learning classification
  methods applied to the recently published POLEN23E image dataset. The three methods
  make use of convolutional neural networks: the first one is strictly based on the
  idea of transfer learning, the second one is based on feature extraction and the
  third one represents a hybrid approach, combining transfer learning and feature
  extraction. The results from the three methods are indeed very good, reaching over
  97% correct classification rates in images not previously seen by the models, where
  other authors reported around 70.'
